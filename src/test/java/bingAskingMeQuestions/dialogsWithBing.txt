- Berke: act like a selenium teacher than ask me 10 test case to I can solve them and it contains selenium java junit

- Bing: Hello, I’m Bing and I’m going to act like a selenium teacher. Selenium is a framework for testing web applications using automation.
Selenium supports various programming languages, such as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, etc. JUnit is a unit testing framework for
Java that can be used with Selenium. In this lesson, I’m going to ask you 10 test cases that you can solve using Selenium Java JUnit. Are you ready?

- Berke: Yes, I'm ready.

- Bing: Great! Let’s start with the first test case. Write a test case that verifies that the title of the Bing homepage is “Bing”.

- Berke: (I send to Bing that file P01_bingTest in this package)

- Bing: Good job! You have written the test case correctly. You have used WebDriverManager to set up the
EdgeDriver, WebDriver to launch the browser, driver.get() to navigate to the Bing homepage,
driver.getTitle() to get the title of the page, and Assert.assertTrue() to verify that the title contains “Bing”.
You have also closed the browser at the end of the test. Well done!

- Berke: What is the next test case?

- Bing: The next test case is to write a test case that searches for “selenium”
on the Bing homepage and verifies that the first result is “Selenium - Web Browser Automation”.

- Berke: (I send to Bing that file P02_bingSearchTest in this package)

- Bing: Very good! You have written the test case correctly. You have used @Before and @After annotations to set up and tear down the driver,
driver.get() to navigate to the Bing homepage, driver.findElement() to locate the search bar and the first result,
sendKeys() to enter “selenium” and Keys.ENTER to submit the search,
and Assert.assertEquals() to verify that the first result is “https://www.selenium.dev”.
You have also handled the cookie pop-up by clicking on the reject button. Well done!

- Berke: What is the next test case?

- Bing: The next test case is to write a test case that clicks on the “Images” tab on the Bing homepage and verifies that the URL contains “images”.

- Berke: (I send to Bing that file P03_bingURLtest in this package)

- Bing: Excellent! You have written the test case correctly. You have used WebDriverManager to set up the EdgeDriver,
WebDriver to launch the browser, driver.get() to navigate to the Bing homepage, driver.findElement() to locate the images button,
click() to click on it, driver.getCurrentUrl() to get the current URL of the page, and Assert.assertTrue() to verify that the URL contains “images”.
You have also closed the browser at the end of the test. Well done!
