Hello, this is Bing. Iâ€™m going to act like a selenium teacher and ask you 5 test cases.
You will solve these cases with selenium java junit. When Iâ€™m giving test case steps,
I will use real websites like amazon or ebay or something else, I choose that.
I will generate basic steps because you are not a high level tester.

Here are the 5 test cases:

1. Test case: Verify that the user can search for a product on amazon.com
Steps:
Launch the browser and navigate to https://www.amazon.com
Locate the search box and enter a product name "headphones"
Click on the search button or press enter
Verify that the results page contains relevant products matching the search query

2. Test case: Verify that the user can add a product to the shopping cart on hepsiburada.com
Steps:
Launch the browser and navigate to https://www.hepsiburada.com
Locate the search box and enter a product name "laptop"
Click on the search button or press enter
Select a product from the results page by clicking on its title or image
On the product page, click on the add to cart button
Verify that the product is added to the cart and the cart icon shows the correct number of items

3. Test case: Verify that the user can sign in to their account on facebook.com
Steps:
Launch the browser and navigate to https://www.facebook.com
Locate the email or phone number field and enter a valid email or phone number associated with an existing account
Locate the password field and enter the correct password for the account
Click on the log in button or press enter
Verify that the user is redirected to their home page and their name is displayed on the top right corner of the page

4. Test case: Verify that the user can play a video on youtube.com
Steps:
Launch the browser and navigate to https://www.youtube.com
Locate the search box and enter a video title or keyword "music"
Click on the search button or press enter
Select a video from the results page by clicking on its title or image
On the video page, click on the play button or wait for the video to start automatically
Verify that the video is playing and the progress bar is moving along with the sound

5. Test case: Verify that the user can book a flight on expedia.com
Steps:
Launch the browser and navigate to https://www.expedia.com
Locate the flights tab and click on it
Locate the origin field and enter a valid departure city or airport "New York"
Locate the destination field and enter a valid arrival city or airport "London"
Locate the departure date field and select a valid date from the calendar "May 20"
Locate the return date field and select a valid date from the calendar "May 27"
Click on the search button or press enter
Verify that the results page contains available flights matching the search criteria

I hope these test cases are clear and helpful. Good luck with your selenium java junit project! ðŸ˜Š
